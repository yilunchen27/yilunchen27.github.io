  I'm currently a Research Associate in Optimization and Data Science, with passion in large-scale machine learning models and scalable data-driven decision-making leveraged in cloud computing. My career goal is to combine the state-of-art in modeling with the science and engineering behind scalable machine learning system development and to solve industrial problem with higher-order of efficiency.

  My research interest is majorly in the application development in NLP & Graph Network analysis, and Auto Machine Learning System and Deep Learning Architecture. I also have theoretical knowledge experience of Bayesian Statistics, Multi-Armed Bandit Problems, Optimization and Game Theory.

  Apart from my research time, I am equipping myself with software development and cloud computing skills. For example, I am taking specialities from Coursera, such as Data Engineering, Big Data on GCP, TensorFlow: Data and Deployment, Advanced Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform, Cloud Architecture with Google Cloud and AWS Foundation. I have some hands-on experience on software development using Java, specifically in developing Android APP and Website APP.
